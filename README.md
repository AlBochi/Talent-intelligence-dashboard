# Talent Market Intelligence Engine

> A strategic platform for capital-efficient team scaling and market-informed talent acquisition.

## The Problem

Executives and technical leaders driving digital transformation (Cloud, AI, FinOps, DevSecOps) often make critical hiring decisions based on intuition and outdated market data. This leads to:
- **Cost Overruns:** Misaligned salary bands and costly mis-hires.
- **Strategic Delays:** Inability to accurately gauge the feasibility of building new capabilities.
- **Competitive Disadvantage:** Slow, reactive hiring processes that fail to secure top talent.

## The Solution

The Talent Market Intelligence Engine is a dynamic dashboard that transforms raw talent market data into actionable strategic insights. It answers critical business questions:

*   **"What is the true cost and availability of building a FinOps team in Canada vs. the US?"**
*   **"Should we hire senior MLOps engineers or upskill our internal DevOps cohort?"**
*   **"What are the emerging skill trends for Cloud Security experts we need to plan for?"**

This tool de-risks multi-million dollar technology investments by providing a data-driven foundation for talent strategy.

## Key Features

*   **Real-time Salary Benchmarking:** Aggregates compensation data across geographies and seniority levels.
*   **Skill Supply Heatmaps:** Visualizes the concentration and availability of specific skill sets (e.g., "Kubernetes", "SageMaker").
*   **Strategic Modeling:** Allows for "what-if" analysis for team expansion and capability building.
*   **Competitive Analysis:** Tracks talent movement and hiring trends among key market players.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** Next.js, React, Chart.js/D3.js
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Python
*   **Data Pipeline:** Apache Airflow, BeautifulSoup/Scrapy
*   **Database:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL
*   **Deployment:** Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP
